						It is hard to find a person who has not heard the words: mobile phone, communicator, smartphone, mobile phone. At the same time, for many people
						there is confusion in defining the difference of these terms.
						The most popular designation of a device for making calls is phone, in turn, if the phone is not stationary, it is called mobile, because of ÑŽ
						autonomous work
						and the possibility of moving or cellular, which emphasises its work in the system of cellular communication.

						The cellular/mobile phone replaced the conventional home phones and made a dizzying breakthrough in people's lives, bringing dramatic
						changes in the world development and the life of each owner of this gadget. But, technology has developed rapidly and in a few years the term
						"operating system"
						appeared. It was the operating system that made it possible to transform the characteristics of an ordinary mobile phone
						into a smartphone, supplementing the capabilities of the former with the functionality of a computer.
